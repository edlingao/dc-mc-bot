# Minecraft Discord Bot for ngrok users

I built this to help my friends get the latest ngrok string to connect into my raspberry minecraft ip server string

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
    - `TOKEN`: Your discord bot token
    - `WHITE_LIST_DIR`: The directory where your `white-list.json` file is located
    - `VERSION`: The version of your minecraft server
4. Run the bot with `npm start`
